### About

I am a Software Engineering graduate from London Metropolitan University with hands-on experience building modern, scalable web applications. My work sits at the intersection of frontend architecture, animation systems, and clean backend design.

I focus on predictable component systems, performance-safe motion, and maintainable codebases. I care more about correctness, structure, and long-term scalability than trendy abstractions.

### Core Stack

**Frontend**
- Next.js App Router
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- GSAP for timeline-based animation
- Framer Motion for UI state transitions
- Radix primitives with shadcn/ui

**Backend**
- Node.js with Fastify
- REST APIs
- Prisma ORM
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB

**Engineering Practices**
- Component-driven architecture
- Strict TypeScript
- Clean separation of UI, animation, and logic layers
- Performance-focused animation design
- CI/CD oriented workflows

### Selected Work

Most of my recent work focuses on rebuilding systems rather than patching them.
That includes:
- Migrating legacy UI into modular component systems
- Decoupling animation layers from layout logic
- Improving runtime performance and interaction clarity
- Designing predictable, scalable frontend architectures

Live examples and breakdowns are available on my portfolio.
